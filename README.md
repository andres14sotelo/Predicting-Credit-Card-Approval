# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approval

This project is from DataCamp and the objective of this notebook is to predict whether you will be approved of credit cards or denied. I use a machine learning model, Logistic Regression to classify whether you will get accepted or denied. First, we clean the data, process the data, split into train ans test sets, perfrom cross validation, then we implement the Logistic Regression Model.
